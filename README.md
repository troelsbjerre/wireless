# Wireless Challenge

This is a mod to help you play the Factorio challenge: Wireless / SteamPunk.

The challenge is quite simple: play without ever transmitting power over wires.
The mod helps achieve this by diconnecting any electrical pole you place.
It does not prevent you from manually adding connections later, but then you are actively avoiding the challenge.
Electrical poles still distribute power, but only locally within their own area of effect.
A direct consequence is that power must be generated right next to where it is to be used.
This will typically mean running pipes of steam around your factory, and sooner rather than later also in trains around the base and to distant mining outposts.
This also kills the vast solar fields, though solar panels still remain useful for small power needs.

I won't spoil anymore about the solutions you will have to come up with.
I had a blast in a couple of playthroughs, and I hope you will too.

Here is a list of ideas for self-imposed restrictions:

* (easy) No sub-stations: they mostly reduce the challenge to steam distribution.
* (hard) ... and no medium electric poles: in this challenge, medium poles are waaay better than small ones.
* (pure) No circuit (red/green) wires: this makes the larger bases harder, where you need them to control train stations.
